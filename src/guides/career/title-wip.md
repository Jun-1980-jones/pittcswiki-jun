The purpose of this guide is to give you actionable steps based on your current school year.

## Freshman
As a freshman you should have two goals: acclimating yourself to college and getting any experience possible.

### Acclimating to College
Adjusting to college is easier said than done. Below are some basics we recommend

#### Find your group
We recommend you keep joining new clubs, trying new things, and immersing yourself in the college experience until you have a trustworthy and reliable group of friends around you. College isn't easy and having a support system around you is going to be key to your success.   

If you're struggling to meet new people we highly recommend you don't give up and keep joining new clubs and finding ways to participate on campus. Eventually you'll have a breakthrough!

#### Learn discipline 
College will be a vastly different experience than high school as now it is your perogative to make sure you succeed in your endeavors. Try to make sure that in addition to new social and extracurricular obligations you find time to study and do well in your classes and other academic/professional commitments.

Discipline will be very important once you start applying to internships in the future as the interview process will end up being very intense and you'll have to be able to balance it alongside all your other responsibilities.  

#### Take care of yourself
Be kind to yourself as you go through college. You'll be encountering a lot of new experiences and for all the highs that you will have, there will also be lows. 

Make sure you are happy with your current situation. Do you like the people you are around? Do you like your major? Do you even like Pitt? Be truthful in answering these questions and you'll be greatly helping your future self.

### Any Experience Possible
If you're a freshman, the truth is you probably do not have much coding/professional experience, making it super hard to stand out as a candidate. Be scrappy and try to get any experience possible. Here are a couple of options:

#### Teaching Assistant/Peer Tutoring
If you do pretty well in your classes then you should apply to be a Teaching Assistant or Peer Tutors. Pitt CS never has enough of either which means getting the position will be non-competitive and you will get the opportunity to be paid to teach CS!

Applications usually open up mid Fall or Spring semester, but you can also ask your current CS professors to remind you. 

#### Personal Projects
It hurts when companies won't hire you for entry level technical experience because you don't have any technical experience. In these scenarios, the best way to show off your technical skills is by doing personal projects. 

Learn a new language, go to hackathons, or help solve a current problem you have with code! Once you do a personal project you then can put it on your resume and talk to companies about it. Though it may be intimidating in the beginning, it also is a lot of fun!

#### Research / Freshmen Internships
Freshmen in the past have gotten research positions and internships but it isn't easy. The best way to maximize your chances for an internships is to apply to [all the freshmen programs](https://pittcs.wiki/career/freshman-sophomore-opportunities/) and hope one of them stick.

[Rsearch](https://pittcs.wiki/academics/research/) is similarly tough since it often involves domain knowledge that most freshmen don't have. We recommend you get to know your current CS professors and the research they are currently conducting. Ask if they are looking to hire/mentor a freshman, or if they know any professor who is. 

#### Any Opportunity
Whether it's volunteering at a local school or a club leadership position, we recommend you try to take advantage of any opportunity that is thrown your way as each opportunity is a chance to grow your network and get any semblance of technical experience. You never know what might happen!
